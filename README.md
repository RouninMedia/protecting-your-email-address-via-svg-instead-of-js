# Protecting your email address via SVG instead of JS
Email addresses published on webpages usually need to be protected from email-harvesting spambots.

Conventionally, email protection techniques utilise a combination of HTML, CSS and JS-based approaches, each subject to their own pros and cons.

In general, approaches involving JS tend to be more sophisticated than alternatives based on HTML and / or CSS. But the downside, from one perspective, is that JS then becomes an unavoidable dependency of that page. The same school of thought advocates that while JS may enhance pages, ideally we should want those pages to work even when javascript is turned off.

This technique comes from an entirely different place. It's different from all conventional email protection techniques.

Because it's **SVG-based**.
